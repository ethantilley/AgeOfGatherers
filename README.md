# AgeOfGathers
AI simulated environment of wood and berry gatherers... and one builder for storage upgrades. 

This project makes use of:
* Goal-Oriented-Action-Planning (GOAP) for AI Behaviours.
* A* (A Star) Path Searching Algorithim with my own little twist for different behaviours.
* Manager AI that decideds for them when to switch to and from roles based on the corresponding storage capacity.
* Procedural terrain generation + generation of path data.

# <b> DISCLAIMER </b>
This project is unfortunately not the most commented code of mine. The code itself however is quite good considering it was my first real go at AI (AI behaviours using GOAP, A* pathing algorithm, etc.).
